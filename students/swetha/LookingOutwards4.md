This street artists has created sculptures that capture an ‘invisible man’

This is an interesting project and has been done in a variety of ways by other artists (and anonymous artist with a similar project is featured on this site: http://www.coolstuffdirectory.com/2013/03/creative-art-that-looks-weird.html) 

This is a different way of capture because you are not trying to capture a real thing but trying to capture the audience’s expectations for what the real thing should be. In a way these sculptures capture their audience's previous notions of what they resemble (a man) and projects it back to the viewers. This way, the sculptor has captured an invisible man. This project in particular is evocative because of the posturing of the invisible man. in one picture he is hunched over and looks almost homeless while in another he is leaned against the wall and seems to be melding into it. To me, this is a reminder of the invisibility of struggle in our society. It is easy to think of America as a place that is open and free to all individuals but we all realize that on some level this is false. Poverty, struggle, hunger, and more are swept under the rugs in america as we focus on healing these injustices in other countries. I wish the artist made it more apparent what his stance on this issue is through repetition of the figure or the figure placed in informative locations (banks, cemetary, etc).
