#Third person Video Games Using the Oculus

This is a very interesting project that is more towards research with the oculus but can also be interpreted as art.

This man was able to view himself walking around (as if he is sitting above and behind himself and viewing himself as some omniscient force) through the use of an elaborate set up where he places gopros on and behind his. This setup allows him to walk around while looking at himself through his oculus. This is an exciting prospect or 3rd person games of the future; Virtual reality does not mean we have to be ourselves, we have perhaps control another character through a similar process. This idea also has a certain charm since it plays on the notion of voyeurism since you are essentially enjoying a voyeuristic view of yourself ; people are always interested in themselves and this project illustrates that beautifully by explaining the lengths one will go to see themselves from another perspective in real time.
